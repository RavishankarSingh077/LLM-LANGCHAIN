# LLM-LANGCHAIN
ü§ñ My LLM Projects using LangChain, OpenAI, LLaMA2, Hugging Face, Flask, and RAG
Welcome to my LLM Projects collection!
In this repo, I have created different small apps using Large Language Models (LLMs). These apps are made with tools like LangChain, OpenAI, LLaMA2, Hugging Face, Flask, ChromaDB, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

You can ask questions from different sources like:

A PDF file

A website

A .txt file

Or just type any question and get an answer from AI

üìÇ List of Projects
1. Ask Me Anything ‚Äì OpenAI
A basic app where you can type any question and get answers using OpenAI GPT model.

2. Ask Me Anything ‚Äì LLaMA2
Same as the first one, but it uses LLaMA2 model running on your computer (no internet required).

3. LLaMA2 with Flask + HTML Page
This project is made using Flask and a simple HTML page where you can ask questions from LLaMA2. You can run it in your browser easily.

4. Ask Questions from PDF ‚Äì LLaMA2 + ChromaDB
In this app, you can upload a PDF file, and then ask questions from its content.
It uses LLaMA2, stores the PDF data in a vector database (ChromaDB) and uses RAG technique to give answers.

5. Ask Questions from Website URL
Here, you can paste any website link.
The app reads the content of the website and then you can ask anything related to it using LLaMA2 + ChromaDB + RAG.

6. Ask Questions from Text File (.txt)
In this project, you can upload or paste text (from a .txt file).
It will store the text in a vector DB and allow you to ask questions from it using LLaMA2 and RAG.

7. Hugging Face Model Integration
This app uses Hugging Face Transformers models instead of OpenAI.
You can load and run models from Hugging Face locally or from the cloud, and ask questions using those models.

8. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Demo
This project shows how RAG works using LLaMA2 or Hugging Face model + a vector DB (like Chroma).
It finds the best context and gives more accurate answers.

üß† Tools and Technologies Used
LangChain ‚Äì To build LLM apps easily

OpenAI GPT ‚Äì For cloud-based language model

LLaMA2 (Ollama) ‚Äì Open-source LLM running on your machine

Flask ‚Äì To make web apps with HTML interface

Streamlit ‚Äì For fast Python web apps

ChromaDB ‚Äì A vector database to store and search data

Hugging Face Transformers ‚Äì For running models like BERT, LLaMA, etc.

BeautifulSoup ‚Äì To read website data

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) ‚Äì To combine search + LLM for better answers

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why I Made These Projects
To understand how LLMs work with documents, websites, and custom inputs

To learn and apply vector search, embeddings, and local LLMs

To build AI tools that can be useful in real-world use cases

üí° Future Plans
Add chatbot UI

Improve design and performance

Add support for audio and video inputs

Use larger Hugging Face models with GPU
